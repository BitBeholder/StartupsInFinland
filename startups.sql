Modular, circular and smart:
Parkly transforms public places with a modular, scalable solution, by creating a platform for hanging out and enjoying the urban greenscape. Parkly modules are easy to mix and match, scale up and down, and use in different locations. 

Placemaking as a service:
Parkly creates places where people can sit down, relax, and meet others. Whether a public square, parklet, office space or residential yard - great public places connect people. Parkly offers an easy alternative to slow and expensive renovations. It is a great tool for experiments too. Our services range from urban gardening workshops to green care, and are designed to pump life into the place. Parkly is also a great platform for community-driven activities. 

More urban green:
The green Parkly modules provide more biodiversity with pollinator friendly plants, more edible experiences with urban gardening boxes, and more trees to public places. 
 
Platform for co-creation: 
We are building up the module catalogue with a co-creation model and offer custom designs too. Parkly is a tool for making participation easy and visible for participants and planners alike. Together with our collaborators we offer services ranging from workshops, green care, maintenance, planning and consultation, and data collecting.

Circular at heart:
Parkly is created with sustainability at its core. It is part of the circular economy striving for the wise use of resources, and long life cycles. Our goal for Parkly is to pave the way for the green transition in cities by making the transformation of public places easy and inspiring. For every Parkly module produced we compensate 20 square meters of old-growth forest in Finland via the Finnish Natural Heritage Foundation.');

Powerful workflows, feature rich, built-for purpose

POINTR implements remote-first field services through powerful workflows: create, share, organize, and report. With more than a hundred of industry-focused features co-created with our customers, POINTR is the most feature-complete remote collaboration solution in the market. It is is built for purpose. Starting off as a space industry solution for enabling interplanetary human exploration, it has taken a decade of innovation and engineering to build the tool for critical missions on Earth: secure power, vehicular machines, maritime, and medical.

The development of the remote collaboration concept of POINTR and the foundations of the reliable and secure telecommunication protocol XRTC started in 2008. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Thales Alenia Space Italy (TAS-I), and the European Space Agency (ESA) played an important role in supporting the creation and commercialization of this technology. The principal investigators – Dr. Boris Krassi and Sauli Kiviranta founded Delta Cygni Labs as a VTT spin-off in June 2013.

POINTR collaboration software was inspired by the original product space exploration projects, based that revolutionary telecommunication technology, became available for the applications here on Earth. Since the foundation, the company was grown by combining private and public investment: the core R&D in Finland, sales and marketing team, IPR protection, subsidiary in Germany, and branch partner offices in LATAM, USA, and Japan with 40 professionals around the globe.

Today Delta Cygni Labs is a deep tech enterprise working towards the same goal: a world where knowledge is shared without limits, powered by a technology that does not substitute humans but empowers them to solve problems anywhere, anytime, together.');

It takes around 11 000 litres of unpolluted water to grow 1 kilogram of cotton. That means a single t-shirt requires as much as 2700 litres of water. 

Cotton clothing producers waste about 15% of the raw material. We don''t make our products from virgin material. Instead, Pure Waste recycles the offcuts and spinning waste from clothing and textile industries. The raw material is collected, sorted by colour and quality, and mechanically opened back into the fibre. Then we mix it with recycled polyester or viscose and spin it into new yarns. After that, the process is the same as with virgin materials except that our yarns and fabrics don’t need to be dyed as their colour comes from the textile waste.');

A fact that most consumers are becoming keenly aware of. Consumption’s new companion is guilt and for good reasons.

Ironically many people don’t care about owning material goods the way they used to. They care about the experience. To put it simply, it’s about what you can do, not what you own. This is large-scale cognitive dissonance and unsustainable for both people, businesses, and our planet.

We need a world that shares more. One that is made to make less. 
But todays commerce softwares are almost exclusively designed for selling ownership, not access. To grow sales via quantity, not quality. This makes it unnecessarily complicated for both customers and businesses to discover the vast potential of outside ownership. 

Rentle closes this gap between supply and demand effortlessly. Our platform empowers merchants to expand their commerce from unit sales to service, 
from ownership to access — while retaining full control of their customer experience.

Give your customers what they need when they need it. Let them return it when they don’t. It’s easy, it’s smart, it’s more sustainable and It’s simply The Way They Want.');

Finland, like other countries, generates huge amounts of textile waste. An estimated amount of 350 million kg of used textiles are disposed, as waste annually in the Nordic region. Finland’s share of this is around 100 million kg, of which about 80% is incinerated at the end of it’s life-cycle. This amount includes textiles used by both consumers and businesses. An EU directive, to be transposed into Finnish law as the new 2025 Waste Act, will oblige municipalities to set up and organise the collection of domestic used textiles. This in order to boost the quality of secondary raw material and its uptake. 

The circular economy facility being built by Rester Oy in Paimio aims to ensure that businesses can dispose their end of life cycle textiles sustain-ably. The facility will focus on producing new raw material from used textiles with an annual capacity of 6,000 tonnes. Time-frame for the completion of this high-tech facility is Q1/2021. This is an significant project on European level thus enabling a completely new circular and sustainable economy service model for processing companies’ operating in the New Nordics');

Tornion Panimo on käsityöläispanimo, joka toimii edelleen samoilla sijoilla, mihin panimo rakennettiin jo vuonna 1873. Panimomme alla ovat alkuperäiset, 140 vuotta vanhat kellariholvit, jotka saavat pian uuden elämän viskikellareina. Viskeistä ja muista viinoista voit lukea lisää kohdasta Tislaamo.

Vielä vuonna 2010 täällä tehtailtiin Lapin Kultaa yli 200 miljoonan litran vuosikapasiteetilla. Suurteollisuuden väistyttyä palautimme legendaarisen panimon juurilleen käsityöläispanimoksi. Panemme tällä hetkellä olutta käsityöläislaitteistolla, jonka keittokoko on 1000 litraa ja vuosikapasiteetti 200 000 litraa. Teemme siis vähän, mutta sitäkin parempaa olutta.

Maaliskuussa 2017 aloitamme uuden panimolaitteiston asennuksen. Aidosta Tornion teräksestä rakennettu laitteisto kasvattaa kokonaiskapasiteettimme lähelle 2,5 miljoonaa litraa vuodessa. 

Kasvaa pitää, jotta yhä useammat pääsevät nauttimaan aitoa Lapin olutta. Kerran suuren nähtyämme kuitenkin ymmärrämme, että olut on parhaimmillaan, kun sen tekevät pienet ihmiset suurella sydämellä. Pysymme siis jatkossakin leppoisina lappilaisina käsityöläisinä. 

Kaikki tuotteemme ja reseptimme kehitetään emoyhtiömme Sangenin laboratoriossa, missä touhuavat todelliset tieteen ja juomataiteen propellipäät. Laatumme on siis takuulla testattua ja kaikenlaista uutta kokeillaan jatkuvasti. 

Seuraavan kerran kun näet komean tornilogomme, tartu siihen ja nauti. Lapin reissuillasi suosittelemme poikkeamaan panimollamme. Järjestämme ryhmille tilauksesta panimokierroksia ja olutmaistajaisia.');

The onset of more than 50% of mental disorders happens during youth, which makes targeting prevention towards children and young people important. However, existing healthcare services fall short in their ability to prevent long-term negative impact on child and adolescent health. Consequently, only 1 in 4 children with mental health issues receives treatment at the moment.

Digital medicine is highly relevant when it comes to youth mental health in two fundamental aspects: detection of emerging mental illness and providing youth-friendly treatment.

Our DTx platform combines psychosocial research, validated psychological techniques and data analytics to assess, monitor as well as support the mental health of children and induce the creation of healthy habits during gameplay. Unlike most other commercially available digital health solutions, the digital intervention is based on the Self-Determination Theory of motivation and behaviour change. Through a game environment, research-based content is delivered to educate, monitor and support children in a personalised manner.

The Challenge

Just like moms and dads around the world, we love our kids. Yet we face a challenge: How to help our kids grow up happy, healthy and smart. We started from  nutritious and wholesome food. When we couldn''t find a brand that would put our kids health and wellbeing first, we decided to start one.

We found that grocery store shelves are filled with products aimed at our kids that are not actually very good for them - they contain far too much sugar, salt and saturated fats, with very little fiber and other beneficial nutritional ingredients.

We felt that it was wrong because we know that what we feed our kids now has both short and long-term effects on their health and the quality of their lives through to adulthood. The global childhood obesity epidemic shows that we need to act now.

Our Solution

Since we are not experts in nutrition or health, we got in touch with scientists at the University of Helsinki and experts in food production, medicine and early childhood education and started to develop products for kids that are wholesome.

Making sure our kids grow up healthy and strong is something we strive for.');
